### Hello everybody, my name is Alexis Vel√°zquez. 

### I'm studying Technologyst Degree in Computer Science at UTEC, university from Uruguay. 

### In UTEC, I've improved my skills about Functional Programming and Data Structures with C/C++, Concurrent Programming and Parallelization using semaphores with C++ and Python, Databases design and management with MySQL from console, BASH scripting, Logic Gates basics, among others.

### On the other hand, I'm actually learning python and their libraries PyGame and Tkinter as also OOP in a self-taught way.

### I will add new repositories as I develop new projects applying what I have learned.

### You are all welcome!
